# OpenMetrics to Markdown

Looking for a way to document your [OpenMetrics](https://openmetrics.io/)? Me too! OpenMetrics-to-Markdown is a _React_ application that converts an _OpenMetrics_ file to a Markdown file. Just paste the plaintext of an _OpenMetrics_ or [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) output into the text area. The application will convert the _OpenMetrics_ file to Markdown and display the results in the text area.
